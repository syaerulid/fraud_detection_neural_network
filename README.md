# Fraud Detection using Autoencoder

What's this project about?
"The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust fraud detection system that can effectively distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones using state-of-the-art Autoencoder neural networks and the Keras framework.

By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this research aims to enhance financial security and protect businesses and consumers from financial fraud.
